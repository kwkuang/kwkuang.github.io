Hi guys, 

New website (wah?!) to serve as my portfolio and as something I can put on my resume because I have been lacking in the personal coding projects for the past..... 4 years... unfortunate.

I will hopefully continue to live my webdev dreams and update this website consistently but as it is just my portfolio site, I doubt much will be updated.

Probably a few of my more "professional" updates and such.

That's probably all I have to say.

Thanks for checking my site out, 

Kris
